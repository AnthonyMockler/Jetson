            <h3>What is UNHCR Innovation Jetson?</h3>
            <p>Jetson is a predictive analytics platform aimed at providing better data to deliver better decisions. We measure multiple variables to see how changes many effect internally displaced populations. Jetson is an experimental project launched by UNHCR&rsquo;s Innovation Service in 2017 to better understand how data can be used to predict movements of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>The Predictive Analytics Engine Project<br>
            </h4>
            <p>The Predictive Analytics Engine (Jetson) is an applied predictive analytics project taking concrete steps to provide insights on the future of displacement. </p>
            <br>

            <p>The project is the first step is understanding data about a) the population flow and b) some of the most common variables that are correlated with the population flow. The project focused on the catalysts that might cause people to flee their homes in the Somalia situation. The main objective is to make predictions about potential displacement events by utilizing data mining, statistics, modeling, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence to analyse different data and yield some preliminary conclusions.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The project aims to raise awareness and understand the above-mentioned variables, by obtaining information from structured and unstructured data points (e.g. data sources such as the UNOSAT and WMO) that will lead to better decision-making actions.The secondary aim is to identify and map existing humanitarian data gaps and services in select operations in order to improve access to demand-driven, insightful information in education, energy and the environment, connectivity, business models/cash and other key areas.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>What is a predictive simulation?</h4>
            <p>The project currently is in design phase. We are building a very simple simulation model with basic human-made rules. This is &nbsp;the type of modelling that is used for predicting movements in ant colonies or in financial markets. As we gather data, later on, we hope to replace the simulation model with comprehensive model that can analyze both macro variables (external) such as conflict, climate and food insecurity data, but also behavioral or micro variables such as particular population vulnerabilities, intent of movement and other multiple contextual variables that can be later be connected by a machine-learning algorithm. Initial research explorations for this more comprehensive model are related to having a robust <a href="https://www.openabm.org/book/export/html/3443">agent-based modeling </a>and simulation (ABMS) or conducting a sensitivity analysis of <a href="http://www.systemdynamics.org/what-is-s/">system dynamics modeling</a>. </p>

            <h4>5 Project Assumptions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The project is focused only in the population flow, both across borders and internally. This means the main research purpose is to measure changes in the population in an specific period of time (e.g. a year)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>There is not one single major cause of forced displacement. There are many causes (variables) and infinite combination of these variables, along with behavioral human patterns that leads to forced displacement. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This project attempts to find interesting and meaningful patterns in data, making assumptions from the data our partners are providing. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Some of the assumptions &ldquo;do not need a model to tell a person that&rdquo; the assumption is correct. Building a model goes beyond identifying the assumptions&rsquo; characteristics (e.g. we do not need a model to know people are forced to flee due to conflict). However, the model attempts to find the best combination that could predict the target variable, in this case: population flow</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Satellite data analysis, improving the quality of analysis:</h4>
            <p>Using two data points (17th January 2017 and 21st April 2017), it is possible to see an increase in the presence of shelters in Baidoa over a three month period. The rows of orange structures shown here found southeast of the airport perimeter (April image), are assumed to have been erected by newly arrived IDPs to Baidoa. These arrivals have also been confirmed in population data sourced from the <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/country.php?id=197">Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN</a>). These structures are considerably smaller than existing structures in Baidoa, including pre-identified IDP settlements. From immediate observation these shelters are assumed to have been &lsquo;self-constructed&rsquo; by individual households, from a similar source of shelter materials, including orange tarpaulin. Orange tarpaulins are often provided by NRC as NFI/shelter distributions; there presence/support in establishing these shelters would need to be confirmed. </p>
